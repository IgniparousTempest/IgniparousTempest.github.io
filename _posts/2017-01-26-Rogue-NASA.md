I feel quite strongly about science popularises who don't back up their claims with evidence, it undermines their very valid message.

I came across a new phenomenon: dissident twitter accounts claiming to represent individuals that are linked to United States government entities.

[@RogueNASA](https://twitter.com/RogueNASA) is quite cool, see below:

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How sad is it that government employees have to create rogue Twitter accounts just to communicate FACTS to the American public?</p>&mdash; Rogue NASA (@RogueNASA) <a href="https://twitter.com/RogueNASA/status/824325249693057027">January 25, 2017</a></blockquote>

Unfortunately they (often) make strong claims without linking to any form of reliable verification, which hurts their message a bit. Yet again, they are aiming for the general audience, so maybe not.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Awww that&#39;s cute. We have data on our side. What do you have? Cheetos?</p>&mdash; Rogue NASA (@RogueNASA) <a href="https://twitter.com/RogueNASA/status/824354140818182144">January 25, 2017</a></blockquote>

Great! Our claims should always be backed up with reliable data.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Carbon dioxide levels have risen from 280 ppm to 400 ppm in the last 150 years. This is a fact that can be backed up with data. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/climate?src=hash">#climate</a></p>&mdash; Rogue NASA (@RogueNASA) <a href="https://twitter.com/RogueNASA/status/824322717830807552">January 25, 2017</a></blockquote>

That's great, but where is it?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate change is caused by human activities. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/climatechange?src=hash">#climatechange</a></p>&mdash; Rogue NASA (@RogueNASA) <a href="https://twitter.com/RogueNASA/status/824321888096833536">January 25, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Ninety-seven percent! <sup>[citation needed]</sup></p>

That being said, their intentions are great, and the world definitely needs more scientific activism!

As is typical with binary politics in America, liberal idiocy is supporting movements like this. Which hurts the cause further. Maybe liberal idiocy causes less damage than consecrative idiocy? I don't know.

### Images of change

Another great site that (sometimes) lacks supporting information is [NASA: Images of Change](http://climate.nasa.gov/images-of-change?id=589#589-flooding-on-the-ganges-river-india).

The following is titled, "[Flooding on the Ganges River, India](http://climate.nasa.gov/images-of-change?id=589#589-flooding-on-the-ganges-river-india)":

<div>
  <img width="49%" style="margin-right: auto" title="2015" src="{{ page.baseurl }}/images/ganges-before.jpg"/>
  <img width="49%" title="2016" src="{{ page.baseurl }}/images/ganges-after.jpg"/>
</div>

After seeing this and reading the blurb, I'm left wondering: "Is this typical for the region?", "If regular flooding is abnormal, is it increasing? And if so, by how much?"

### Conclusion

I'm nitpicking at very valid causes. I would encourage readers to support both [@RogueNASA](https://twitter.com/RogueNASA) and [NASA: Images of Change](http://climate.nasa.gov/images-of-change). Even if they are sparse on details, at least they push these topics into the general public's discourse, also dedicated readers can always look up the facts independently.
