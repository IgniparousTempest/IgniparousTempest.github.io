										<h2>Why I like the Pocket-RC4 algorithm.</h2>
										<p>See <a href="/posts/pocket-rc4.html">here</a> for a technical description.</p>
									</header>

									<p>In early 2015 myself and a friend participated in an annual info sec competition called HackFu, hosted 
									by MWR labs. There were 9 challenges in total, and the first 10 people to finish them would win a trip 
									to England to participate in a conference/competition. The first of these challenges consisted of a veiled 
									reference to a Pocket-RC4 cipher. This was the last challenge we finished and the challenge we struggled 
									with the most, not because it was the most mentally taxing, but because the passcode we received was 
									very different to the format of the other challenges. What we thought was gibberish tuned out to be Latin. 
									The phrase we decoded was "corvusoculumcorvinoneruit", after building many permutations of this 
									algorithm, my partner noticed the spacing of consonants and vowels and figured that this might be 
									Latin. It tuned out to be <em>corvus oculum corvi non eruit</em>, meaning "a crow will not pull 
									out the eye of another crow.".</p>
									
									<p>We initially assumed it was the Solitaire cipher we were dealing with. After a while we discovered 
									the Pocket-RC4 cipher, with only the original paper and one blog post describing it. During the hours we 
									were stuck on this problem a deck of cards were always present in my hands.</p>

									<h3>And we won!</h3>
									<p>We submitted our solutions to all nine challenges and we won a trip to England. It was my first 
									time visiting another continent. I grew up in very rural parts of Southern Africa, in the Namib desert 
									of southern Namibia and the rolling hills of the Eastern Cape. Visiting a first world country was quite 
									a culture shock. Conversing with Europeans was quite interesting, in the sense that: the things that 
									we took for granted about our own worlds fascinated the other. I was in awe of trains that moved beneath 
									the city, and they were equally in awe of tales of wildlife that freely wondered through my home town. 
									I saw a gemsbok breaking into our yard to steal our figs as a nuisance, they saw it as a tale of wonderment. 
									They saw the daily underground commute as a waste of time, I saw it as an adventure.</p>

									<h3>Contrary to expectations</h3>
									<p>Being an English speaker that grew up in the south of Namibia, it was quite normal that many people 
									could not understand my language. In level of prevalence the languages spoken in this region were: 
									Afrikaans > Oshiwambo > German > English. I expected London to be something out of a Harry Potter movie. 
									Contrary to my expectations, there were not many English present in London and far less English speakers 
									than I had expected. London had contained many surprises, including a group of girls who invited us to go 
									clubbing with them, only to witness these girls initiate a fist fight with a group of men; something I have 
									yet to bear witness to again.</p>
									
									<h3>All thanks to Pocket-RC4</h3>
									<p>Thanks to Pocket-RC4 I got to experience a new continent for the first time, and for this experience 
									this algorithm will always have a special place in my thoughts.</p>
